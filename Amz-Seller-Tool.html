<h2>What is an AMZ Seller Tool and Why You Need It</h2>
<p>An <strong>AMZ seller tool</strong> is a specialized software or Chrome extension designed to help Amazon sellers make better decisions. From finding profitable niches to optimizing listings and analyzing competitors, these tools provide actionable insights that save time and maximize profits. Amazon's marketplace is highly competitive, and without data-driven tools, sellers often waste time on trial-and-error strategies.</p>
<p>MerchFlux is a Chrome extension built for sellers who want to discover the right niches, track keywords, and analyze market trends efficiently. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced FBA seller, using a dedicated AMZ seller tool is essential for success in 2025 and beyond.</p>
